                        I really enjoyed Carrión's explanation on the craft of literature, artwork, language, and structure. Among the standout quotes in his piece, I loved "the most beautiful and perfect book in the world is a book with only blank pages, in the same way that the most complete language is that which lies beyond all the words of a man can say." In isolation, this quote seems misleading and lingers in the reader's mind. However, it carries the essence of his argument: the art of books and language is deeper than our understanding. As a result of our own interpretations and interactions with the work, books (artwork, newspaper, other '2-D' works, etc) come to life in space-time--I love this connection. In class, you prefaced that this reading may be cumbersome, but I found it fascinating. I feel that Carrión applied his own lessons well––the structure and phrasing of his work was so compelling.

                        Schwulst and Carrión seem to be in conversation with one another. I like their shared understanding of typically 2D texts/platforms as temporal spaces. I found Schwulst's point about the structure of websites as buildings, shelves, gardens, etc. very compelling. The duality of being an artist and architect allows us to take more intention in our website creation, as they are often a living and breathing expression of ourselves. Connecting the two seems to be Édouard's recommendation. I love finding the intersectionality of works, especially music. I usually create my playlists with this intention––I order and group songs based on ones that are in conversation with one another (both musically and lyrically). I never considered how creating these connections actually furthers our memory and recall of them, as mentioned in his Gardening Technique.

                        The transformation of print echoes Carrión's work about the extension of work into its medium. Switching from physical print to digitized work will change the experience of the reader. In my opinion, there is high opportunity for an enhanced experience––the artist or author have more control over the format of their work.
                        With that said, I still am unsure how to place myself on the spectrum of new media evangelists/pro-digital and more traditionalists/pro-paper (for lack of a better shorthand description). I agree with Carrión's point that the work is beyond its containment, i.e. authors write texts vs. creating books, but the medium may be fundamental to the work. I love print and tangible work. I feel torn is a blended or entirely digital work will be able to capture how tactile paper and bookworks can be.

                        I enjoyed Duvall's definition of hyper-modernism, the recycling of previous work to showcase the changes in post-digital art/design. The power of Disney, particularly the symbol of Mickey Mouse, was a compelling example. Disney is 'hypermodern' due to the impact of its typically unaltered line. Simply the outline of Mickey holds the weight of globalization and American hegemony. It is fascinating to see how this symbol is used abroad, namely the Dubai Democracy poster, where the entertainment catch phrase influences the promise of a better tomorrow for UAE's government. I began searching through 'Mickey Political Posters' online. It's incredible how proliferated this symbol was.

                        The language surrounding design is fascinating. The shapes––'square has associated to it dullness, honesty, and workmanlike meaning; the triangle, action, conflict, tension; the circle, endlessness, warmth, protection'––are described in way that feels so accurate and attentive. I would personally have not found the language to describe the associations of the shapes, yet these fundamentals shapes do carry these associations in each of their contexts. The dialogue about shapes in conversation––how  'the dots assemble and reassemble into constellations that read more like sentences-initiating, picking up, or expanding on an idea'––is interesting. It feels foundational for our recent reversion back to shape communication, with emojis and emoticons. I doubt that was the designer's intention with geometric communication, but it's compelling to compare the organization of simple circles to the more complex 'modern hieroglyphics'.

                        I really enjoy the styling of this guide. The typeface and layout of the pages is easy to read and quite visually pleasing. In terms of content, the authors claim that artists are not good describers of their own work but the skill can be developed. I enjoy this sentiment, as language is a beautiful tool and skill for enhancing artwork. The examples of the Instagram descriptions stood out to me––I loved @candystore's alt-text. This poetic summary compliments the image well and serves as a motiving example of the power of alt-text.

                        The abstract approach to surface is fascinating. The American Express black card example is compelling––how elitism extends and transforms from gold territory to black surface.  I kept rereading the notion that 'the city becomes the profit base of a virtual spin: the multiplication of surface accounts for the exponential growth of value extracted from its public space.... the inhabitants of cities are, through this mechanism, directly inscribed into the means of value production.' The proliferation of profitability and access to attention is widely discussed, but I enjoy the perspective of surface in this conversation.

                        I really enjoyed Ramsey's reading, my family has echoed similar sentiments about the inaccessibility of english coding. His most compelling point is the rebuttal on coding being 'binary' or simply '0's and 1's'. The process for translation begins in ASCII/HEX code. My sophomore year, I coded a compiler, and each iterative step is in English. This point landed for me, because my mother used to explain her initial difficulty with learning coding. English is her second language. Though she is now proficient as an adult who moved to the US over 20 years ago, she spoke only Hindi, while growing up, and found the English proficiency barrier high enough that she decided against pursuing computer science as a degree.

                        Saulellis presents an interesting dissection of post and feeds. The post has shifted from an interruption to an infinitely flowing collection. I don't believe that all posts are disruptive, but I do agree that they beg for our attention. We scroll, hoping that a post is an interruption from our mindless consumption, but we are often unentertained. This hints at the 'new boredom,' how we are separated in space but together in time in our consumption. This is the connective tissue for online communities––we consume content 'together' and we take pride in our curation. Our feeds are an extension of ourselves. We take prides in the reels, tweets, and tiktoks that consume us. Feeds reflect our interests, personalities, insecurities with high accuracy. I've never articulated my relationship to my feed (likely to avoid the existential crisis that would follow), but I find the depth of my relationship to my online consumption concerning. I don't know whether this consumption is truly additive to my life; I cannot quantify the value and costs of my internet exposure.

                        I was unaware of women's significance in computational history––I feel much more pride as a female CS major. I cannot help but ponder the lack of history in my degree. I was completely unaware of the origin of software and hardware jargon. It's pretty messed up to think about how commanding 'a girl' translates to commanding a device. The conversation with Aiken and Hopper was fascinating too, a tribute to the times.
